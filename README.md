### Usage

Create a workflow file in your repository, for example `workflow.yaml`:

```yaml
name: Localize strings
on:
  push:
    paths:
      - locales/**
jobs:
  localize:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Localize strings
        uses: voloshinskii/localize-ai@v1.0.2
        with: 
          model: gpt-4
          openai-token: ${{ secrets.OPENAI_TOKEN }}
          locales-path: ./locales
          main-locale: en

      - name: commit and push all changed files
        env:
          CI_COMMIT_MESSAGE: Localize new strings
          CI_COMMIT_AUTHOR: CI
        run: |
          git config --global user.name "${{ env.CI_COMMIT_AUTHOR }}"
          git config --global user.email "username@users.noreply.github.com"
          git commit -a -m "${{ env.CI_COMMIT_MESSAGE }}"
          git push
```

### Known limitations
- Only supports .json
- Pluralization is not supported now
- Huge changes in the file can lead to 429 error from OpenAI API. GPT-4 has 200 RPM limits right now. I should batch prompts in future.
